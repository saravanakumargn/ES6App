<h2>Collections - Map</h2>
<p>Three new Collections: SET(like Array), MAP(Key-Value Object) and WEAKMAP(like Map, but different)</p>
<h2>Map object</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 6 introduces a new data structure to map values to values.</p>
<p>A Map object is a simple key/value map and can iterate its elements in insertion order.</p>
<p><code>map.set</code> and <code>map.get</code> methods are used to set and retrive the values from the Map colloection.</p>
<h4>Basic usage</h4>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
var sayings = new Map();
sayings.set("dog", "woof");
sayings.set("cat", "meow");
sayings.set("elephant", "toot");
console.log(sayings.size); // 3
console.log(sayings.get("cat")); // meow
console.log(sayings.get("fox")); // undefined
console.log(sayings.has("bird")); // false
for (var [key, value] of sayings) {
  console.log(key + " goes " + value);
}
// "cat goes meow"
// "elephant goes toot"

sayings.clear();
console.log(sayings.size); // 0

<p>Traditionally, objects have been used to map strings to values.</p>
<p>Objects allow you to set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key.</p>
<p>Map objects, however, have a few more advantages that make them better maps.</p>
<ul><li>The keys of an Object are Strings, where they can be of any value for a Map.</li><li>You can get the size of a Map easily while you have to manually keep track of size for an Object.</li><li>The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements.</li><li>An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map. (this can be bypassed using map = Object.create(null)).</li>
<p>These three tips can help you to decide whether to use a Map or an Object:</p>
<ul><li>Use maps over objects when keys are unknown until run time, and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.</li><li>Use maps in case if there is a need to store primitive values as keys because object treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value or any other primitive value.</li><li>Use objects when there is logic that operates on individual elements.</li></ul>
