<h2>Let</h2>
<p>The <code>let</code> statement declares a block scope local variable (not function level scope like <code>var</code>).</p>
<section hljs>
let count = 2;
console.log(value); // 2
function fun() {
    let count = 4; // different value assigned to count
    console.log(count); // 4
}
fun();
console.log(count); // 2
</section>

<p>Redeclaring the same variable within the same function or block scope raises a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<section hljs>
let count = 2;
let count = 3; // Identifier 'count' has already been declared
</section>

<h4>Hoisting</h4>
<p><code>let</code> will hoist the variable to the top of the block. However, trying to access the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a <code>ReferenceError</code>.</p>
<section hljs>
function fun() {
    console.log(count); // ReferenceError: count is not defined
    let count = 4;
}
fun();
</section>

<p>let and const are hoisted (like var and function), but there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed. This period is the <code>temporal dead zone (TDZ)</code>.</p>
<section hljs>
var count = 1;
console.log(count); // SyntaxError: Identifier 'count' has already been declared
let count = 4;
</section>
<p>Still the above statement throwing error. Because of <code>TDZ</code></p>

<h4>What is temporal dead zone (TDZ) in ES6</h4>
<p>In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a <code>ReferenceError</code>.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why const and let have temporal dead zones:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>To catch programming errors:</b> Being able to access a variable before its declaration is strange. If you do so, it is normally by accident and you should be warned about it.</li>
    <li><b>For const:</b> Making const work properly is difficult.</li>
    <li><b>Future-proofing for guards:</b> JavaScript may eventually have guards, a mechanism for enforcing at runtime that a variable has the correct value (think runtime type check). If the value of a variable is undefined before its declaration then that value may be in conflict with the guarantee given by its guard.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Constants</h2>
<p><code>const</code> works like <code>let</code>, but the variable you declare must be immediately initialized, with a value that can’t be changed afterwards.</p>
<p>The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value.</p>
<p>Declaration and Usage</p>
<section hljs>
const PI;
console.log(PI); // Missing initializer in const declaration
</section>
<p>The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.</p>
<section hljs>
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // 3.14
PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // Identifier 'PI' has already been declared    
</section>
<p>Cannot re-assign any value to const after declration.</p>
<section hljs>
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.(…)
</section>

<h4><code>const</code> Scope</h4>
<section hljs>
const PI = 3.14;
function fun() {
    const PI = 3.141;
    if(true) {
        const PI = 3.14159;
        console.log(PI); // 3.14159
    }
    console.log(PI); // 3.141
}
console.log(PI); // 3.14
fun();
// Outputs
// 3.14
// 3.14159
// 3.141
