<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>JavaScript has been a prototypal based language using object prototypes to create object inheritance and code reuse.</p>
<p>The new ES6 Class adds a new syntax on top of traditional prototypes.</p>
<p>The class syntax has two components: <b>class expressions</b> and <b>class declarations</b>.</p>
<h4>Class declarations</h4>
<p>One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class ("Person" here).</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
class Person{
    constructor(_firstName, _lastName) {
        this._firstName = _firstName;
        this._lastName = _lastName;
    }
}
</section>
<h4>Class expressions</h4>
<p>A class expression is another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body.</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
//Unnamed
var Person = class {
    constructor(_firstName, _lastName) {
        this._firstName = _firstName;
        this._lastName = _lastName;
    }
}
//named
var Person = class Person{
    constructor(_firstName, _lastName) {
        this._firstName = _firstName;
        this._lastName = _lastName;
    }
}
</section>
<h4>Constructor</h4>
<p>The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. </p>
<p>There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class.</p>
<p>A <code>SyntaxError</code> will be thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.</p>
<p>A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of a parent class.</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    fullName() {
        return this.firstName+' '+this.lastName;
    }
}
let p = new Person('java', 'script');
console.log(p.fullName()); // java script
</section>
<h4>Hoisting</h4>
<p>An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are <a title="hoisted: Hoisting is a term you will not find in the JavaScript docs. Hoisting was thought up as a general way of thinking about how execution context (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript. But, hoisting can lead to misunderstandings. For example, hoisting teaches that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top your coding, but this is not what happens at all. What does happen is the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stays exactly where you typed it in your coding." ng-click="showAlert($event)">hoisted</a> and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a <code>ReferenceError</code>:</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
var p = new Person(); // ReferenceError
class Person {}
</section>
<h4>Static methods</h4>
<p>The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are also not callable when the class is instantiated.</p>
<p>Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    fullName() {
        return this.firstName+' '+this.lastName;
    }
    static MarksFirstLast(...marks) {
        let sorted = marks.sort(function(a, b){return b-a});
        return 'First '+sorted[0]+' '+'Last '+sorted[marks.length-1];
    }
}
console.log(Person.MarksFirstLast(7, 4, 8, 2, 9)); // First 9 Last 2
</section>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class.</p>
<p>ES6 introduced two keywords <code>extends</code> and <code>super</code> to inherit properties and methods from parent class.</p> 
<p>The <code>extends</code> keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class.</p>
<p>The <code>super</code> keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent.</p>
<section hljs hljs-no-escape>
class Person{
    constructor(_firstName, _lastName) {
        this._firstName = _firstName;
        this._lastName = _lastName;
    }
    fullName() {
        return (this._firstName+' '+this._lastName).toUpperCase();
    }
}
class student extends Person {
    constructor(_firstName, _lastName, _grade) {
        super(_firstName, _lastName);
        this._grade = _grade;
    }
    studentDetail() {
        return 'FirstName:'+this._firstName+' LastName:'+this._lastName+' Grade:'+this._grade;
    }
}

var s = new student('firstname', 'lastname', '3rd');
//Calling parent function
console.log(s.fullName()); // FIRSTNAME LASTNAME
console.log(s.studentDetail()); // FirstName:firstname LastName:lastname Grade:3rd
